# Employee Management System
A clean and simple employee management system template created using the bootstrap css framework. 
The template includes a login page, a dashboard, and employees page, and a job page.
The employees page shows current employees, and the jobs page shows the current jobs available.
Though nothing is functional, there are buttons for the option to delete, edit, and get more details.
